# basic algo

- calculate velocity of movable objects in active area
- find all colliding pairs (graph?)
  - create movement bounding rectangles and quadrangle "rays" 
  - broadphase collision detection with bounding rectangles
  - narrowphase collision detection with quadrangle "rays"
- collision response with all colliding pairs (graph?)
  - binary search to find collision point
  - (later in dev) apply remaining velocity of heaviest, still colliding body, and repeat
